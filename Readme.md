What is Box shadow?
The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.

Inset - Changes the shadow from an outer box-shadow to an inner box-shadow (as if the content is pressed into the box). 

Note: The default color of the shadow is the current text-color.
